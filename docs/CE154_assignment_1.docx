====================================================
TASK 2: WEBSITE DESIGN
====================================================

2.1 Design inspiration research

Website 1: Awwwards portfolio examples (general reference)
URL: https://www.awwwards.com/websites/portfolio/
Thoughts:
- Strong visual hierarchy with a clear hero section.
- Minimal navigation that remains readable over imagery.
- Good balance between artwork presentation and whitespace.

Website 2: Behance portfolio pages
URL: https://www.behance.net/
Thoughts:
- Grid-based portfolio presentation is effective for multiple artworks.
- Card layouts help viewers scan quickly.
- Calls to action should be clear and repeated.

Website 3: Tate artist pages
URL: https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists
Thoughts:
- Informative structure for biography and context.
- Typography and contrast are readable and accessible.
- Navigation categories can be reused for artist + shop workflows.

2.2 Visual direction and design decisions

- Genre selected: Contemporary urban visual art.
- Look and feel: Warm off-white background, earthy accent color, simple gallery card layout.
- Navigation: Top-right functional unordered-list links (Home, Portfolio, Shop, About, Contact, Cart).
- Brand placement: Artist name/logo at top-left on every page.
- Homepage structure:
  1) Centered heading
  2) Centered featured image
  3) Centered button (View Gallery / Browse)
  4) Centered introduction/description (Lorum ipsum placeholder text)
- Footer structure (consistent across pages):
  - Center: copyright and update date
  - Right: contact details
  - Far right: social media links
- Consistency: same header/footer, type scale, spacing, and button style on all pages.
- Device support: optimized at 1080px width and adapted for 480px width without horizontal scrolling.

2.3 Wireframe and mock-up notes

- Wireframe approach used in code structure:
  - Header (logo + nav)
  - Main content module (page-specific)
  - Footer (three information zones)
- Shop page includes at least five merchandise items.
- Product detail page includes all required metadata fields:
  ID, title, description, item type, published date, thumbnail image.
- Basket supports edit quantity and remove item using front-end JavaScript.

====================================================
TASK 4: WEBSITE REVIEW
====================================================

4.1 Evaluation with users

Questionnaire (3 questions):
1) What do you like most about the design?
2) What feels missing or unclear?
3) What would you change in colour, layout, or navigation?

Summary of collected opinions (3 potential users):
- User A liked the centered homepage focus and simple menu labels.
- User B asked for clearer product detail links from Shop cards.
- User C suggested larger touch targets for mobile navigation.

Actions taken after feedback:
- Kept concise labels and clear hero presentation.
- Included direct "View details" links on each shop item.
- Ensured responsive layout with wrapped nav and readable spacing on small screens.

4.2 Automatic evaluation against W3C

Method:
- HTML validated via https://validator.w3.org/nu/ (same engine as W3C upload validator).
- CSS validated via https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/.
- Results log saved as docs/validation_report.txt.

Final validation results:
- index.html: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- portfolio.html: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- shop.html: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- product.html: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- about.html: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- contact.html: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- cart.html: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- css/style.css: valid, 0 errors, 0 warnings

Bugs fixed during iterative validation:
- Corrected heading hierarchy on portfolio and shop pages.
- Added a heading to the basket items section to satisfy section semantics.

4.3 Self appraisal

Strengths:
- Consistent visual language across all required pages.
- Good structural HTML with external CSS and semantic content blocks.
- Basic accessibility included (alt text, readable contrast, responsive behavior).

Limitations:
- No backend/cart persistence in this phase.
- Contact and checkout flow are static placeholders.
- Could further improve keyboard focus styling and deeper ARIA patterns.

Skills to improve next:
- Advanced responsive typography systems.
- Progressive enhancement for forms and feedback.
- Deeper accessibility testing with screen-reader workflows.

Skill tree document:
- Include your Lab 1 skill tree file in docs, or copy it into this document before final submission.
